Checkout the code
	 git clone c48.csl.toronto.edu:/home/maxim/linux-2.6
	 this will create the linux-2.6 directory in the current directory

Compiling
	go to the linux-2.6 directory
	make mrproper
	cp dump_config .config
	make oldconfig
then to make configuration changes, run (needs ncurses istalled)
     make menuconfig
to compile run
   make
to install run as root
   make install
   create a grub entry for the kernel

   sample grub menu entry

root            (hd0,0)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.28 root=/dev/sda1 ro

to build tests
   cd linux-2.6/test
   make
to start checkpoint
   run load_kernel.sh script as root
to restore after the checkpoint
   run run_test in test directory
to write a new test
   put the test .c files in linux-2.6/test directory
   include test.h
   enable_save_state() will checkpoint the current process when the load_kernel.sh script is executed
   was_state_restored() will return non-zero if the state of the current process was restored, 0 otherwise
